I am a Predoctoral Research Fellow at Yale Department of Economics with Professors Seth Zimmerman and Barbara Biasi. I have also been advised by Christopher Stanton at Harvard Business School. I graduated Yale with a B.A. in Economics with Distinction. I am broadly interested in labor and public economics. 

I have worked in the President's Council of Economic Advisors, the U.S. Department of Treasury Office of Economic Policy, and the Brookings Institution Economic Studies.
