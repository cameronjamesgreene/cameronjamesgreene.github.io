I am a Predoctoral Fellow at the Yale Department of Economics with [Seth Zimmerman](https://economics.yale.edu/people/seth-zimmerman) and [Barbara Biasi](https://economics.yale.edu/people/barbara-biasi). I have also been advised by [Christopher Stanton](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=602452) at Harvard Business School. I graduated Yale with a B.A. in Economics with Distinction. I am broadly interested in public economics, labor economics, and education.

I have worked in the President's Council of Economic Advisors, the U.S. Department of Treasury Office of Economic Policy, and the Brookings Institution Economic Studies.
